# ElevenLabs Setup

Napkin Audio AI Studio is designed so ElevenLabs keys stay server-side. Do not put real API keys into frontend code.

## 1. Create `.env`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your key and a real ElevenLabs voice ID:

```env
VITE_PROVIDER_PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id_here
PORT=8787
CORS_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

Keep `.env` local. It is ignored by Git.

`npm run server` reads `.env` automatically. For local development, `.env` wins over inherited shell values so a stale key in your terminal cannot block the key you paste here.

## 2. Start both processes

Terminal 1:

```bash
npm run server
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 3. Verify in Napkin Audio AI Studio

- Open the app.
- Switch to Producer Mode.
- Go to Voices.
- Click `Check Providers`.
- Click `Generate voice take` from the Voices tab.

Expected result after adding a key:

- ElevenLabs key: `Detected`
- Default voice: `Configured`
- Audio routes: `Ready`
- A new recording take appears with an audio player and provider `elevenlabs`.

If the key, default voice, or proxy is missing, the same button creates a mock take and explains the fallback reason. This keeps demos moving without exposing keys in the browser.

## Server-side ElevenLabs routes

The local proxy keeps the API key out of the browser and forwards these routes:

- `POST /api/voice/elevenlabs/preview`
- `GET /api/voice/elevenlabs/voices`
- `POST /api/voice/elevenlabs/voice-changer`
- `POST /api/sound/elevenlabs/effect`
- `POST /api/music/elevenlabs/compose`
- `POST /api/dubbing/elevenlabs/create`

Voice catalog loading returns real ElevenLabs voices when a key is configured. Without a key, it returns a mock catalog so role mapping can still be demonstrated locally.

Voice, VO voice transformation, sound effect, and music routes return audio bytes from ElevenLabs when a real key is configured. The Voices tab can save the speech preview into the current browser session as a take. Dubbing currently supports JSON requests with a public `sourceUrl`; durable audio asset storage and final mix rendering are still future work.

## Current limitation

Generated preview audio is held as a browser object URL for review. If the browser reloads, the take record remains but the temporary audio preview expires. Final exportable asset storage and full mixed-spot rendering still need a production storage/rendering layer.

## Safe curl checks

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/providers/status
```

These endpoints return booleans only and do not expose the key.
