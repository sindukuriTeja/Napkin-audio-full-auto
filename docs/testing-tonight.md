# Napkin Audio AI Studio Testing Checklist

Use this checklist for a focused manual test session.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run demo:check
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL shown by Vite, usually `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`.

`npm run demo:check` does not start a local server or call provider APIs. It verifies provider status redaction, the demo-safe mock voice catalog, and the imported RAG knowledge file.

Optional provider proxy smoke test:

```bash
npm run server
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/providers/status
```

Optional Ollama reachability check, needed only for the Llama 3 production-plan flow:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags
```

## Core Flow

- Dashboard loads with project name, brand, duration, approval status, quality score, versions, and next craft move.
- "Generate full production plan" (Studio tab) with Ollama running returns a script, voice roles, sound cues, music cues, and a brand mnemonic within a few minutes.
- With Ollama unreachable, the same action fails with a clear connection/timeout error instead of hanging silently.
- Brief fields can be edited without crashing.
- Duration can be changed to 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 120 seconds.
- Script tab accepts pasted copy and reparses it.
- `.txt` and `.md` upload works.
- Unsupported upload types show a clear warning.
- Parser identifies SFX, music, legal, CTA, announcer, character, and brand mnemonic lines.
- Parsed lines can be edited directly.
- New script lines can be added manually.
- Script lines can be deleted manually.
- Line type can be manually retagged.
- Voice role can be manually assigned to voice lines.
- Performance notes can be adjusted line by line.
- Timing updates and warnings are understandable.
- Legal lines show clear performance guidance.
- Irish Delivery shows Craft Quality score, score band, suggested actions, and recommendation.
- Voices tab shows voice roles and can generate a voice take.
- Without the provider proxy or keys, voice take generation falls back to a mock take record with a clearly labelled synthetic WAV placeholder.
- With `npm run server` and valid ElevenLabs values in `.env`, voice take generation returns an audio preview through the server proxy.
- Voice roles can be added and edited.
- VO Voice Transformer requires consent before attempting a provider preview.
- Full-spot render downloads a single `full-spot.mp3` covering every spoken line (requires ElevenLabs credentials).
- Sound Design shows sound cues, SFX/music controls, and visual timeline.
- Mix sliders move and do not break layout.
- Export tab downloads project JSON, script markdown, cue sheet, QC report, Craft Quality report, and production notes.
- Export station and preset can be changed.
- Producer Mode shows station delivery details and unknown confidence warnings.
- Project JSON can be imported again using `Import JSON`.
- Browser refresh preserves the current project through autosave.
- `New Project` clears the browser autosave after confirmation.

## Command Flow

Try these commands:

- `Slow down the legal line`
- `Make the ending land`
- `Add a Cork accent`
- `Make the music more cinematic`
- `Remove the sound effect at five seconds`

Try the Audio Director microphone button with one of the same directions where browser speech recognition is available.

For each command:

- Typed or spoken command appears in Memory > Command Log.
- Status starts as `proposed`.
- `Apply` changes status to `applied`.
- `Reject` changes status to `rejected`.
- Applied commands create a new version entry.
- Browser refresh preserves the command state.

## QC And Approval

- QC shows human approval as fail until status is explicitly changed to `Approved for broadcast`.
- Station spec remains unknown/unverified.
- Rights warnings remain visible for unknown music/SFX assets.
- The app never claims the spot is automatically broadcast-ready.

## Known Non-Goals For Tonight

- Do not expect real mastering, loudness, clipping, or true peak analysis.
- Do not expect verified station delivery specs.
- Do not enter real API keys into the frontend.
- Do not treat mock voice takes as production assets.
- Do not present synthetic placeholder audio as AI voice output.
- Do not expect generated preview audio to survive a browser reload; exportable asset persistence is still future work.

## Issue Notes

Record each issue with:

- Browser and device.
- What tab you were on.
- Script or project JSON used.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Expected result.
- Actual result.
- Screenshot if visual.
