# Napkin Audio AI Studio

Napkin Audio AI Studio is a local-first AI audio craft studio for writing, directing, judging, and packaging radio advertising work. It is designed for creative directors, copywriters, producers, sound designers, and agency teams who need a practical studio for script craft, timing, performance, sound design, rough mix planning, QC, and export discipline.

This repo was prepared from the original RA Studio build pack and recreates/improves the earlier `test-codex-2` Broadcast Blueprint Studio direction inside the current Napkin Audio repository.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run server
npm run build
```

For a focused manual QA pass, use [docs/testing-tonight.md](docs/testing-tonight.md).

Use `New Project` in the header to clear the browser autosave after exporting JSON.

For ElevenLabs credential setup, use [docs/elevenlabs-setup.md](docs/elevenlabs-setup.md).

For the current local studio knowledge retrieval layer, use [docs/rag-knowledge.md](docs/rag-knowledge.md).

## What is included

- Vite, React, and TypeScript app.
- Brief panel with brand, campaign, audience, tone, mandatories, legal lines, duration, accent, and sonic notes.
- Script paste and `.txt` / `.md` upload.
- Deterministic script parser for voice, announcer, character, SFX, music, pause, legal, CTA, and brand mnemonic lines.
- Runtime estimator, words-per-second calculation, legal speed risk, and duration warnings.
- Emotion, comedy, timing, performance, sound design, mix, station delivery, QC, and Craft Quality agents.
- Voice casting panel with mock take generation.
- VO Voice Transformer path for approved source recordings, consent confirmation, and ElevenLabs speech-to-speech preview generation.
- Voice-provider abstraction for `MockVoiceProvider`, `ElevenLabsProvider`, and `NvidiaRivaProvider`.
- Optional local provider proxy scaffold for server-side provider credentials.
- Sound world panel and visual timeline.
- Rough mix control surface.
- Audio Director for spoken production decisions, plus typed command fallback.
- Browser speech-recognition support where available; spoken commands become reviewable Apply/Reject proposals.
- Apply/reject command proposals, with browser autosave for the current project.
- Local seed RAG-style studio knowledge retrieval for timing, casting, sound design, mix, export QC, and compliance guidance.
- Craft Quality Score with sub-scores, strengths, improvements, next craft move, and producer-review guidance.
- Irish radio export preset and station-spec data with confidence labels.
- QC checks for duration, mandatories, CTA, legal speed, voice assignment, rights, station specs, and human approval.
- Export downloads for project JSON, script markdown, cue sheet markdown, QC markdown, Craft Quality markdown, and production notes markdown.
- Project JSON import for continuing a previously exported package.
- Studio Memory, command log, and version history.

```

The MVP is deterministic and local-first. Agents accept structured project state and return structured recommendations. They do not overwrite user work automatically. Provider interfaces are present so real services can replace the local heuristics later.

## Provider setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when you add real provider work:

```env
VITE_APP_NAME=Napkin Audio AI Studio
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=
ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICE_ID=
NVIDIA_RIVA_ENDPOINT=
NVIDIA_RIVA_API_KEY=
NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY=
PORT=8787
CORS_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

Important: the frontend MVP does not call real voice APIs with secrets from the browser. A local provider proxy is available with `npm run server`; it keeps provider keys server-side and can forward live ElevenLabs speech, SFX, music, and source-URL dubbing requests when credentials are configured.

Provider proxy endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /api/providers/status`
- `GET /api/voice/elevenlabs/voices`
- `POST /api/voice/elevenlabs/preview`
- `POST /api/voice/elevenlabs/voice-changer`
- `POST /api/sound/elevenlabs/effect`
- `POST /api/music/elevenlabs/compose`
- `POST /api/dubbing/elevenlabs/create`
- `POST /api/voice/riva/preview`

## ElevenLabs

The app includes an ElevenLabs provider path for `voice_id`, `model_id`, text, output format, settings, pronunciation support, continuity context, source VO voice transformation, sound effect prompts, music prompts, and source-URL dubbing jobs. The proxy can return live audio bytes, but the frontend still needs asset persistence and mix rendering before this is a complete production audio workflow.

## NVIDIA Riva / NIM

The NVIDIA Riva adapter is a planned enterprise adapter for streaming/offline synthesis, SSML, pronunciation dictionaries, and emotion controls where available. NIM is represented in the provider architecture as a future reasoning provider. Neither is required for local MVP use.

## Irish radio export

The app includes a generic Irish radio package preset and station rows for RTE Radio 1, RTE 2FM, Today FM, Newstalk, FM104, 98FM, Spin, iRadio, Galway Bay FM, Cork's Red FM, Beat, Midlands 103, Highland Radio, LMFM, Sunshine, Classic Hits, Q102, and Other/custom.

Station-specific technical values are deliberately marked `unknown` unless verified. Napkin Audio AI Studio does not fabricate sample rate, loudness, true peak, naming, or delivery requirements. Confirm station traffic specs before dispatch.

## Rights and approval

Napkin Audio AI Studio never labels a spot broadcast-ready automatically. QC can say a package is checked or ready for producer review, but only an explicit user action can set `Approved for broadcast`.

Rights records track source, licence status, owner, expiry, territory, channel, notes, and confidence. Unknown or needs-clearance rights are flagged before export.

## Craft Quality Score

Craft Quality is a lightweight final-stage quality gate. It gives an overall score out of 100 and sub-scores for idea strength, script clarity, emotional impact, comedy/memorability, performance, voice direction, sound design, timing, brand fit, CTA/legal handling, and production readiness.

It does not claim awards performance, guaranteed effectiveness, or automatic broadcast approval.

## Known limitations

- No full spot rendering or mastering in v1.
- `.docx` upload is not implemented; paste extracted text or upload `.txt` / `.md`.
- ElevenLabs live calls require the local provider proxy plus a configured key and plan access; NVIDIA Riva and NIM remain scaffolds.
- Loudness, true peak, clipping, file format, head/tail silence, and station compliance checks are placeholders until production audio analysis is added.
- Station specifications remain unverified and must be confirmed with current station delivery requirements.
- Studio knowledge retrieval is currently local keyword scoring over seed and imported Manus chunks, not a full external vector RAG pipeline.

## Next development phases

1. Persist returned provider audio as project assets.
2. Add real audio preview/rendering with Web Audio or server-side FFmpeg.
3. Add `.docx` parsing.
4. Add richer version compare/restore.
5. Add station-spec verification workflow and dated source links.
6. Add real asset-rights intake for uploaded SFX/music.
7. Add automated tests around parser, QC, and Craft Quality scoring.
8. Add Manus knowledge-pack ingestion and optional embedding/vector search.
